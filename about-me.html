                    Bio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a first-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology in the New Media Interactive Development program. 
                    I am currently working on several web-based projects at RIT.
                    I am also taking classes in database and data management, as well as New Media Design and Software Development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Experience and Strengths
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I primarily focus on front-end design and development for now, but I also have experience in Python and Java in addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    My biggest strengths are my problem solving and ability to work in a team; 
                    I strongly believe that 99% of problems can be solved by effective communication.
                    I also enjoy continuously learning and adapting as I work, it makes me a better developer and I have a better time when I feel like I'm developing my own skills.
                    If there's something I don't know yet, I can pick it up fast!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Hobbies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of class, I enjoy all things music, be it listening or making.
                    I collect CDs, and I often will listen to my favorite albums as I work.
                    I also play trombone with the RIT Pep Band at hockey games.
                    This affinity for music helps me be a more effective team player, as it builds empathy and connection with others, as well as helping me focus.
                </p>
